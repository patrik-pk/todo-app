## Overview
Simple Todo App that I made with a purpose of making something simple. It doesn't look the best, but the point was to practice JavaScript and mostly learn how to use Redux.

You can add/edit/delete category. Every category has its own Todos that you can also add/edit/delete. When you delete a category, all its Todos are removed along with it.
